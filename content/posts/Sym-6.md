Moser's method is one of the most effective techniques in symplectic geometry. It turns the equation "two symplectic forms are cohomologous" into the construction
of an isotopy whose pullback identifies them. Conceptually, it is a controlled way to solve
$$\varphi_1^*\omega_1=\omega_0$$
by producing $\varphi_t$ from a time-dependent vector field $X_t$.

### Time-Dependent Vector Fields and the Basic Variation Formula

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $I\subset \mathbb{R}$ be an interval.

> [!info] Time-Dependent Vector Field and Isotopy
> A **time-dependent vector field** on $M$ is a smooth map
> $$X:I\times M\to TM,\qquad (t,p)\mapsto X_t(p)\in T_pM.$$
> An **isotopy** of diffeomorphisms $\{\varphi_t\}_{t\in I}$ is said to be generated by $X_t$ if
> $$\frac{d}{dt}\varphi_t = X_t\circ \varphi_t,\quad \varphi_0=\mathrm{id}.$$

> [!danger] Global Existence of Flows
> If $M$ is compact, every smooth time-dependent vector field integrates to a globally defined isotopy on any compact time interval.
> If $M$ is noncompact, global existence still holds if $X_t$ is compactly supported (uniformly in $t$) or satisfies a suitable growth bound.
> In the applications below, compactness or compact support is the typical hypothesis.

The key identity is the derivative of a pullback along an isotopy, now allowing the form itself to depend on time.

> [!note] Variation of Pulled-Back Forms
> Let $\{\varphi_t\}$ be an isotopy generated by $X_t$, and let $\alpha_t\in \Omega^k(M)$ be a smooth family of $k$-forms.
> Then
> $$\frac{d}{dt}\bigl(\varphi_t^*\alpha_t\bigr)=\varphi_t^*\Bigl(\dot{\alpha}_t + \mathcal{L}_{X_t}\alpha_t\Bigr),$$
> where $\dot{\alpha}_t=\frac{d}{dt}\alpha_t$.

> [!success] Proof
> Write $\beta_t:=\varphi_t^*\alpha_t$. Differentiating yields
> $$\dot{\beta}_t=\frac{d}{dt}(\varphi_t^*\alpha_t)=\frac{d}{dt}(\varphi_t^*)\alpha_t+\varphi_t^*\dot{\alpha}_t.$$
> The first term is $\varphi_t^*(\mathcal{L}_{X_t}\alpha_t)$ by the definition of Lie derivative as the infinitesimal action of the flow.

> [!idea] Closed Forms
> If $\omega_t$ is a smooth family of **closed** $2$-forms and $\{\varphi_t\}$ is generated by $X_t$, then
> $$\frac{d}{dt}\bigl(\varphi_t^*\omega_t\bigr)=\varphi_t^*\Bigl(\dot{\omega}_t + d(\iota_{X_t}\omega_t)\Bigr).$$

> [!success] Proof
> Apply **Variation of Pulled-Back Forms** with $\alpha_t=\omega_t$, and use Cartan's formula
> $$\mathcal{L}_{X_t}\omega_t=d(\iota_{X_t}\omega_t)+\iota_{X_t}(d\omega_t)=d(\iota_{X_t}\omega_t).$$

### Moser Stability Theorem

We now state the basic stability theorem. The hypothesis "cohomology class is constant" is exactly what ensures
$\dot{\omega}_t$ is exact, which is the solvability condition for the key equation.

> [!note] Moser Stability Theorem
> Let $M$ be a compact manifold and let $\{\omega_t\}_{t\in[0,1]}$ be a smooth family of symplectic forms on $M$.
> Assume that the de Rham cohomology class $[\omega_t]\in H^2(M;\mathbb{R})$ is independent of $t$.
> Then there exists an isotopy of diffeomorphisms $\{\varphi_t\}_{t\in[0,1]}$ with $\varphi_0=\mathrm{id}$ such that
> $$\varphi_t^*\omega_t=\omega_0\quad\text{for all }t\in[0,1].$$
> In particular, $\varphi_1:(M,\omega_0)\to (M,\omega_1)$ is a symplectomorphism.

> [!success] Proof
> Since $[\omega_t]$ is constant, $\dot{\omega}_t$ is exact for each $t$.
> Choose a smooth family of $1$-forms $\sigma_t$ such that
> $$\dot{\omega}_t=d\sigma_t.$$
> (For instance, one may choose $\sigma_t$ by fixing a Hodge decomposition for each $t$; any smooth choice suffices.)
>
> We seek an isotopy $\varphi_t$ generated by $X_t$ such that $\varphi_t^*\omega_t$ is constant in $t$.
> By **Closed Forms**, it is enough to arrange
> $$\dot{\omega}_t + d(\iota_{X_t}\omega_t)=0.$$
> Using $\dot{\omega}_t=d\sigma_t$, this becomes
> $$d\bigl(\sigma_t+\iota_{X_t}\omega_t\bigr)=0.$$
> A sufficient condition is the **Moser equation**
> $$\iota_{X_t}\omega_t=-\sigma_t.$$
> Because each $\omega_t$ is nondegenerate, this has a unique solution $X_t=\omega_t^\sharp(-\sigma_t)$, depending smoothly on $t$.
>
> Since $M$ is compact, the time-dependent vector field $X_t$ integrates to an isotopy $\{\varphi_t\}$ on $[0,1]$.
> For this isotopy, **Closed Forms** and the Moser equation give
> $$\frac{d}{dt}(\varphi_t^*\omega_t)=\varphi_t^*\bigl(\dot{\omega}_t+d(\iota_{X_t}\omega_t)\bigr)=\varphi_t^*(d\sigma_t-d\sigma_t)=0.$$
> Hence $\varphi_t^*\omega_t$ is independent of $t$ and equals $\omega_0$ at $t=0$.

> [!danger] What Really Mattered
> The argument uses three ingredients:
> 1. closedness $d\omega_t=0$ (to simplify $\mathcal{L}_{X_t}\omega_t$);
> 2. nondegeneracy of $\omega_t$ (to solve $\iota_{X_t}\omega_t=-\sigma_t$ uniquely);
> 3. a global existence hypothesis for the flow (compactness of $M$, or compact support of $X_t$ on noncompact $M$).

> [!abstract] Noncompact Variant with Compact Support
> Let $M$ be possibly noncompact. Suppose $\omega_t$ is a smooth family of symplectic forms and that
> $\dot{\omega}_t=d\sigma_t$ where $\sigma_t$ has compact support (uniformly in $t$).
> Then there exists an isotopy $\{\varphi_t\}$ with compact support such that $\varphi_t^*\omega_t=\omega_0$.

> [!success] Proof
> Solve $\iota_{X_t}\omega_t=-\sigma_t$ as before. Then $X_t$ has compact support (since $\sigma_t$ does), so its flow exists globally and equals the identity outside a compact set. The same calculation as in **Moser Stability Theorem** shows $\varphi_t^*\omega_t$ is constant in $t$.

### Relative Moser Fixing a Submanifold

A frequent need is to produce an isotopy that **does not move** a chosen submanifold.
The same method works provided the chosen primitives vanish along that submanifold.

> [!note] Relative Moser Theorem
> Let $M$ be compact and let $\{\omega_t\}_{t\in[0,1]}$ be a smooth family of symplectic forms.
> Let $C\subset M$ be an embedded submanifold such that $\omega_t|_C$ is independent of $t$.
> Assume that there exist $1$-forms $\sigma_t$ on $M$ satisfying
> $$\dot{\omega}_t=d\sigma_t\qquad\text{and}\qquad \sigma_t|_{TC}\equiv 0\ \ \text{for all }t.$$
> Then there exists an isotopy $\{\varphi_t\}$ with $\varphi_0=\mathrm{id}$ such that
> $$\varphi_t^*\omega_t=\omega_0\quad\text{and}\quad \varphi_t|_C=\mathrm{id}_C\quad\text{for all }t.$$

> [!success] Proof
> As in **Moser Stability Theorem**, define $X_t$ by $\iota_{X_t}\omega_t=-\sigma_t$.
> Because $\sigma_t|_{TC}=0$, we have for each $p\in C$ and each $w\in T_pC$,
> $$0=\sigma_t(w)= -\omega_t(X_t,w).$$
> Thus $X_t(p)\in (T_pC)^{\omega_t}$, the symplectic orthogonal of $T_pC$ with respect to $\omega_t$.
>
> Now use the hypothesis that $\omega_t|_C$ is independent of $t$.
> In particular, the restriction $\omega_t|_{T_pC}$ is nondegenerate in directions transverse to $(T_pC)^{\omega_t}$, and the condition $\sigma_t|_{TC}=0$ forces $X_t$ to be tangent to $C$ with zero component along $TC$.
> More concretely: since $\omega_t|_C$ is constant, we may solve $\iota_{X_t}\omega_t=-\sigma_t$ with $X_t$ vanishing on $C$.
> Indeed, at points of $C$ the equation $\iota_{X_t}\omega_t=-\sigma_t$ becomes $\iota_{X_t}\omega_t=0$ on $TC$, and nondegeneracy of $\omega_t$ implies $X_t=0$ along $C$.
>
> Integrate $X_t$ to an isotopy $\varphi_t$. Because $X_t$ vanishes on $C$, the flow fixes $C$ pointwise.
> The same computation as before gives $\frac{d}{dt}(\varphi_t^*\omega_t)=0$, hence $\varphi_t^*\omega_t=\omega_0$.

> [!danger] Remark
> The cleanest way to apply the relative theorem is to arrange $\sigma_t|_{TC}=0$ by construction.
> In local applications, this is often achieved by choosing $\sigma_t$ via a relative Poincar\'e lemma.

### A Local Corollary Template

We will apply Moser's method repeatedly in local form. The following "template" is what one typically checks.

> [!abstract] Local Moser Template
> Let $U\subset M$ be open and let $\omega_0,\omega_1$ be symplectic forms on $U$.
> Assume there exists a smooth family $\omega_t$ of symplectic forms on $U$ with $\omega_t|_{t=0}=\omega_0$, $\omega_t|_{t=1}=\omega_1$,
> and a smooth family of $1$-forms $\sigma_t$ on $U$ such that $\dot{\omega}_t=d\sigma_t$.
> Assume moreover that the time-dependent vector field $X_t$ defined by $\iota_{X_t}\omega_t=-\sigma_t$ integrates to an isotopy on $[0,1]$.
> Then there exists a diffeomorphism $\varphi:U\to U$ (given by time--$1$ of the isotopy) such that
> $$\varphi^*\omega_1=\omega_0.$$

> [!success] Proof
> This is exactly the computation in **Moser Stability Theorem**, restricted to $U$.

> [!danger] Preview
> The local consequences of Moser's method include Darboux's theorem (all symplectic forms are locally standard) and Weinstein's Lagrangian neighborhood theorem (a Lagrangian looks locally like the zero section of a cotangent bundle). We treat these as separate theorems in the next sections, but their proofs are essentially refinements of the same idea.
