## Guiding idea: energy-momentum becomes a tensor once "stuff" is spread out

In I.D we met energy and momentum for *particles* and saw how Poincar\'e invariance organizes conservation laws. But general relativity does not couple curvature to point particles directly; it couples geometry to *matter fields* via a local object: the *stress--energy tensor* $T_{\mu\nu}$.

This lecture does two things in the simplest possible arena (flat Minkowski spacetime):

- We treat classical fields (scalar and electromagnetic) as geometric objects on $(\mathbb{M}^{1,3},\eta)$ with Lorentz-invariant actions, derive their Euler--Lagrange equations, and interpret them physically.
- We compute their stress--energy tensors $T_{\mu\nu}$ and show how local conservation $\partial^\mu T_{\mu\nu}=0$ arises from translation invariance (Noether) and/or from equations of motion.

In the next phases, the *same constructions* will be repeated on a curved Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$, where the slogan becomes:
$$
\text{geometry } g \ \text{responds to matter } T.
$$
Here we only need the flat case, but we will already formulate everything in a way that survives the transition to curved spacetime.

## Conventions

We work on $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ with coordinates $x^\mu=(t,x^1,x^2,x^3)$, metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}=\mathrm{diag}(-1,1,1,1)$, and volume form $d^4x=dt\,dx^1\,dx^2\,dx^3$. We raise indices with $\eta^{\mu\nu}$; thus $\partial^\mu=\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu$. We write $\Box \coloneqq \partial^\mu\partial_\mu = -\partial_t^2+\Delta$ for the d'Alembertian.

## I.E.1 Real scalar fields: action and field equation

### Why scalar fields matter

Even if one is ultimately interested in gravity, scalar fields are a perfect toy model: they carry dynamics, propagate causally, have a stress--energy tensor, and already display the key variational structures. They also appear as effective descriptions (order parameters, inflatons in cosmology, etc.). We treat the classical field theory as a calculus-of-variations problem on Minkowski space.

> [!danger] Lorentz invariance
> The kinetic term $-\frac12\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\,\partial_\nu\phi$ is the unique quadratic form in first derivatives that is invariant under Lorentz transformations (because $\eta$ is the invariant tensor and $\partial_\mu\phi$ transforms covariantly). The potential $V(\phi)$ is a scalar and hence also Lorentz invariant.

> [!danger] Physical reading: hyperbolicity and finite propagation speed
> The operator $\Box$ is hyperbolic. This is the analytic shadow of the causal structure in I.A: solutions propagate inside the light cone. In curved spacetime, the same remains true with $\Box_g=\nabla^\mu\nabla_\mu$: the metric $g$ controls both causal cones and the principal symbol of the wave operator.

## I.E.2 Stress--energy tensor in flat space: definition and scalar field computation

### From conserved 4-momentum to a local tensor

For a field, energy and momentum are not attached to a worldline but distributed throughout space. The correct local object is a rank-2 tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ whose time components encode energy density and momentum density, and whose spatial components encode stresses (pressures and shear).

There are several equivalent routes to $T_{\mu\nu}$:

- (Noether) from invariance under spacetime translations $x^\mu\mapsto x^\mu+a^\mu$;
- (metric variation) by seeing $\eta$ as a background field and varying the matter action with respect to $\eta$.

The second route generalizes directly to GR, so we emphasize it, but we will also connect it to conservation laws.

### Metric-variation definition in Minkowski (preview-compatible)

We treat $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ as a parameter in the Lagrangian density and define $T_{\mu\nu}$ by how $S$ changes under a small change $\eta^{\mu\nu}\mapsto \eta^{\mu\nu}+\delta \eta^{\mu\nu}$.

> [!info] Hilbert stress--energy in flat spacetime
> Let $S=\int \mathcal{L}(\Phi,\partial\Phi;\eta^{\mu\nu})\,d^4x$ be a matter action on Minkowski space. Define
> > $$T_{\mu\nu}\coloneqq -2\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \eta^{\mu\nu}}+\eta_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{L},$$
> where $\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \eta^{\mu\nu}$ is computed by treating $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ as independent variables (symmetrized at the end since $\eta^{\mu\nu}=\eta^{\nu\mu}$).

> [!danger] Why this is the right formula
> In curved spacetime, one defines
> $$T_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta S_{\mathrm{matter}}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}}.$$
> In Minkowski, $\sqrt{-g}=1$ and functional derivatives reduce to partial derivatives at the level of Lagrangian densities. The flat definition is designed so that the flat formula is literally the curved formula specialized to $g=\eta$.

### Scalar field stress--energy

> For the scalar field Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}= -\frac12\,\eta^{\mu\nu}(\partial_\mu\phi)(\partial_\nu\phi)-V(\phi)$, the stress--energy tensor is

> [!success] Proofs

> Only the kinetic term depends on $\eta^{\mu\nu}$, and
> > $$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \eta^{\mu\nu}}
> =-\frac12\,(\partial_\mu\phi)(\partial_\nu\phi).$$
> Plug into $T_{\mu\nu}= -2\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \eta^{\mu\nu}}+\eta_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{L}$:
> > $$T_{\mu\nu}
> =\partial_\mu\phi\,\partial_\nu\phi
> +\eta_{\mu\nu}\left(-\frac12\,\partial^\alpha\phi\,\partial_\alpha\phi - V(\phi)\right),$$
> which is the stated formula.

> [!abstract] On-shell conservation
> If $\phi$ satisfies the equation of motion $\Box\phi-V'(\phi)=0$, then $\partial^\mu T_{\mu\nu}=0$.

> [!success] Proofs

> > $$T_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu\phi\,\partial_\nu\phi-\eta_{\mu\nu}\left(\frac12\partial^\alpha\phi\,\partial_\alpha\phi+V(\phi)\right).$$
> Since $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ is constant,
> > $$\partial^\mu T_{\mu\nu}
> =\partial^\mu(\partial_\mu\phi\,\partial_\nu\phi)-\partial_\nu\left(\frac12\partial^\alpha\phi\,\partial_\alpha\phi+V(\phi)\right).$$
> Expand the first term:
> > $$\partial^\mu(\partial_\mu\phi\,\partial_\nu\phi)=(\Box\phi)\,\partial_\nu\phi+\partial^\mu\phi\,\partial_\mu\partial_\nu\phi.$$
> Expand the second term:
> > $$\partial_\nu\left(\frac12\partial^\alpha\phi\,\partial_\alpha\phi+V(\phi)\right)
> =\partial^\alpha\phi\,\partial_\nu\partial_\alpha\phi + V'(\phi)\partial_\nu\phi.$$
> Subtracting, the mixed terms cancel because partial derivatives commute:
> $\partial^\mu\phi\,\partial_\mu\partial_\nu\phi=\partial^\alpha\phi\,\partial_\nu\partial_\alpha\phi$.
> Hence
> > $$\partial^\mu T_{\mu\nu}=(\Box\phi-V'(\phi))\partial_\nu\phi,$$
> which vanishes on-shell.

> [!danger] Interpretation of components
> In an inertial frame, $T_{00}$ is the energy density, $T_{0i}$ are momentum densities (and energy fluxes up to sign conventions), and $T_{ij}$ encode stresses. For the scalar field one can check
> $$T_{00}=\frac12\bigl((\partial_t\phi)^2+\|\nabla\phi\|^2\bigr)+V(\phi),$$
> which is manifestly nonnegative if $V(\phi)\ge 0$.

## I.E.3 Maxwell field and its stress--energy tensor

### Electromagnetic action and equations of motion

We recall from I.D that $F=dA$ and Maxwell’s equations are $\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu}=J^\nu$ and $dF=0$.

> [!info] Electromagnetic Lagrangian density
> Let $A$ be a potential $1$-form and $F=dA$. The electromagnetic Lagrangian density (with sources) is
> > $$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{EM}}=-\frac14 F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}-J_\mu A^\mu.$$

> [!danger] Minimal coupling and gauge invariance
> The term $-J_\mu A^\mu$ is the simplest Lorentz-invariant coupling to a conserved current. Gauge invariance requires $\partial_\mu J^\mu=0$ so that $A\mapsto A+\partial\chi$ changes the action by a boundary term.

> [!abstract] Maxwell equations from the EM Lagrangian
> Varying $A$ in the action $S=\int \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{EM}}\,d^4x$ yields $\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu}=J^\nu$.

> [!success] Proofs
> This is the same computation as in I.D (vary $A\mapsto A+\varepsilon a$, integrate by parts, and use antisymmetry of $F$).

### Electromagnetic stress--energy

> [!abstract] Electromagnetic stress--energy tensor
> For the electromagnetic field (ignoring the explicit source term), the stress--energy tensor is
> > $$T_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{EM}}
> =
> F_{\mu\alpha}F_{\nu}{}^{\alpha}
> -\frac14\,\eta_{\mu\nu}F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}.$$

> [!success] Proofs
> Start from $\mathcal{L}=-\frac14F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}$. Only index raising depends on $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ since
> $$F^{\alpha\beta}=\eta^{\alpha\rho}\eta^{\beta\sigma}F_{\rho\sigma}.$$
> Treat $F_{\rho\sigma}$ as independent of $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ in this variation. A standard index manipulation gives
> $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \eta^{\mu\nu}}(F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta})= -2\,F_{\mu\alpha}F_{\nu}{}^{\alpha},$$
> hence
> $$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \eta^{\mu\nu}}=\frac12\,F_{\mu\alpha}F_\nu{}^{\alpha}.$$
> Plugging into $T_{\mu\nu}= -2\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \eta^{\mu\nu}}+\eta_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{L}$ yields
> $$T_{\mu\nu}=F_{\mu\alpha}F_\nu{}^{\alpha}-\frac14\eta_{\mu\nu}F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}.$$

> [!abstract] Properties: symmetry and trace
> The tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{EM}}$ is symmetric: $T_{\mu\nu}=T_{\nu\mu}$. Moreover, in $4$ spacetime dimensions it is traceless in vacuum:
> > $$T^\mu{}_\mu = 0.$$

> [!success] Proofs
> Symmetry follows from antisymmetry of $F$ and the identity $F_{\mu\alpha}F_\nu{}^\alpha=F_{\nu\alpha}F_\mu{}^\alpha$. For the trace,
> > $$T^\mu{}_\mu = F^{\mu\alpha}F_{\mu\alpha}-\frac14\cdot 4\,F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}=0.$$

> [!abstract] Energy density and Poynting vector
> In an inertial frame with fields $\vec E,\vec B$, one has
> > $$T_{00}^{\mathrm{EM}}=\frac12\left(\|\vec E\|^2+\|\vec B\|^2\right),$$
> and
> > $$T_{0i}^{\mathrm{EM}} = (\vec E\times \vec B)_i,$$
> up to the sign convention fixed in I.D for identifying $F_{0i}$ with $E_i$.

> [!success] Proofs
> Use the matrix form of $F_{\mu\nu}$ and compute $F_{\mu\alpha}F_{\nu}{}^{\alpha}$ explicitly. One also checks in our signature that
> $$F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}=2(\|\vec B\|^2-\|\vec E\|^2),$$
> and the stated formulas follow.

> [!danger] Physical reading
> The quantity $T_{00}$ is electromagnetic energy density, while $T_{0i}$ gives the energy flux (and momentum density), the Poynting vector. These become central in GR because fields gravitate: even “pure radiation” with $m=0$ has stress--energy and hence sources curvature.

### Conservation law and Lorentz force density

When sources are present, the field stress--energy is not conserved by itself: energy--momentum can flow between matter and field. The correct statement is that the *total* stress--energy (matter + field) is conserved.

> [!abstract] Divergence of EM stress--energy
> Assume Maxwell’s equations $\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu}=J^\nu$ and $dF=0$. Then
> > $$\partial^\mu T^{\mathrm{EM}}_{\mu\nu} = - F_{\nu\lambda}J^\lambda.$$

> [!success] Proofs
> Compute
> > $$\partial^\mu T_{\mu\nu}
> =
> \partial^\mu(F_{\mu\alpha}F_\nu{}^\alpha)-\frac14\partial_\nu(F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}).$$
> Expand the first term:
> > $$\partial^\mu(F_{\mu\alpha}F_\nu{}^\alpha)
> =(\partial^\mu F_{\mu\alpha})F_\nu{}^\alpha + F_{\mu\alpha}\partial^\mu F_\nu{}^\alpha.$$
> Use $\partial^\mu F_{\mu\alpha}=J_\alpha$ for the first piece. For the remaining pieces, use the Bianchi identity
> $$\partial_\mu F_{\nu\alpha}+\partial_\nu F_{\alpha\mu}+\partial_\alpha F_{\mu\nu}=0$$
> to show
> > $$F_{\mu\alpha}\partial^\mu F_\nu{}^\alpha = \frac14\partial_\nu(F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}),$$
> which cancels the second term. The remainder is
> > $$\partial^\mu T_{\mu\nu}=J_\alpha F_\nu{}^\alpha=-F_{\nu\alpha}J^\alpha,$$
> using antisymmetry of $F$ to match signs.

> [!danger] Lorentz force density and total conservation
> The right-hand side is the *negative* of the force density exerted by the field on matter. Thus if a matter tensor satisfies
> $$\partial^\mu T^{\mathrm{matter}}_{\mu\nu}=F_{\nu\lambda}J^\lambda,$$
> then the total tensor $T^{\mathrm{tot}}=T^{\mathrm{EM}}+T^{\mathrm{matter}}$ satisfies $\partial^\mu T^{\mathrm{tot}}_{\mu\nu}=0$. In GR this becomes $\nabla^\mu T_{\mu\nu}=0$ and is structurally tied to the Bianchi identity for curvature.

## I.E.4 General recipe via metric variation (preview of the GR definition)

> [!info] Stress--energy via metric variation (general form)
> Let $(M,g)$ be a Lorentzian manifold and let $S_{\mathrm{matter}}[g,\Phi]$ be a matter action depending on the metric $g$ and matter fields $\Phi$. Define the stress--energy tensor by
> > $$T_{\mu\nu}\coloneqq -\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta S_{\mathrm{matter}}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}},$$
> where $g=\det(g_{\mu\nu})$ and $\delta/\delta g^{\mu\nu}$ is the functional derivative.

> [!danger] What survives from the flat case
> In Minkowski space, $\sqrt{-g}=1$, $\nabla=\partial$, and the functional derivative reduces to an ordinary partial derivative at the level of the Lagrangian density. In curved spacetime, two new features appear:
> - the volume element becomes $\sqrt{-g}\,d^4x$;
> - index raising and the Hodge star depend on $g$, so even “kinetic terms” hide metric dependence.
>
> But the *principle* remains: $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the response of the matter action to variations of the metric.

> [!danger] Why GR cares about this definition
> Einstein’s equation will identify (up to constants) the geometric tensor $G_{\mu\nu}$, built from $g$ and its second derivatives, with $T_{\mu\nu}$, built from matter fields and $g$. The metric-variation definition is the one that makes this coupling conceptually clean: both sides arise as variational derivatives of an action (Einstein–Hilbert + matter).

## Exercises (selected)

> [!question] Problems
> 1. **Energy density for scalar field.** Using $T_{\mu\nu}$ for the scalar field, compute $T_{00}$ in an inertial frame and show $T_{00}=\frac12\bigl((\partial_t\phi)^2+\|\nabla\phi\|^2\bigr)+V(\phi)$.
> 2. **On-shell conservation.** Fill in the missing algebra in the on-shell conservation proof and check carefully where commutativity of partial derivatives is used.
> 3. **Compute EM invariants.** Show that, in our signature convention,
> $$F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}=2(\|\vec B\|^2-\|\vec E\|^2),\qquad (*F)_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}=-4\,\vec E\cdot\vec B,$$
> and interpret these as Lorentz invariants.
> 4. **EM stress--energy components.** Starting from $T_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{EM}}$ and the matrix form of $F_{\mu\nu}$, compute explicitly $T_{00}=\frac12(\|\vec E\|^2+\|\vec B\|^2)$ and $T_{0i}=(\vec E\times\vec B)_i$ (track sign conventions carefully).
> 5. **Divergence identity.** Prove the divergence identity $\partial^\mu T^{\mathrm{EM}}_{\mu\nu} = - F_{\nu\lambda}J^\lambda$ in full detail, including the contraction of the Bianchi identity needed to cancel $\frac14\partial_\nu(F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta})$.
> 6. **Gauge invariance and current conservation.** Show that the action $\int(-\frac14F^2 - J\cdot A)\,d^4x$ is gauge-invariant (up to boundary) iff $\partial_\mu J^\mu=0$.
> 7. **Metric variation (toy computation).** Treat $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ as variables and redo the scalar field computation leading to $T_{\mu\nu}$ for the scalar. Then do the same for the Maxwell Lagrangian to recover $T_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{EM}}$, filling in the omitted index manipulations.
