In this chapter we formalize the idea that symmetries “lower the number of degrees of freedom” of a Hamiltonian system.
Given a Hamiltonian $G$-space $(M,\omega,\mu)$, the Marsden–Weinstein reduction produces a new symplectic manifold (or orbifold, or more singular object) by taking a quotient of a suitable level set of the moment map.

We will first treat the regular, free case in full detail, then look at concrete examples, and finally explain what happens when freeness fails or the moment map is not regular.

## 6.1 Setup: Hamiltonian $G$-spaces and reduced spaces

Let $G$ be a compact Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$.  
We assume we are in the setup of the previous chapter:

- $(M,\omega)$ is a symplectic manifold;
- $G$ acts on $M$ by symplectomorphisms;
- the action is Hamiltonian with moment map $\mu:M\to \mathfrak{g}^*$.

Recall:

> [!info] Hamiltonian $G$-space
> A **Hamiltonian $G$-space** is a quadruple $(M,\omega,G,\mu)$ where
> - $(M,\omega)$ is symplectic,
> - $G$ acts on $M$ by symplectomorphisms,
> - there is an equivariant moment map $\mu:M\to \mathfrak{g}^*$ such that for all $\xi\in\mathfrak g$, the function
>   $$\mu^\xi(p):=\langle\mu(p),\xi\rangle$$
>   satisfies $d\mu^\xi=\iota_{X_\xi}\omega$, where $X_\xi$ is the fundamental vector field generated by $\xi$.

We usually fix $\xi = 0\in\mathfrak g^*$ for notational simplicity; later we will comment on general levels.

### 6.1.1 The candidate reduced space

Let $(M,\omega,G,\mu)$ be a Hamiltonian $G$-space. Consider the zero level $Z:=\mu^{-1}(0)$. We will assume:

1. $0$ is a **regular value** of $\mu$, so $Z$ is a smooth submanifold;
2. $G$ acts **freely and properly** on $Z$.

Under these hypotheses, the quotient
$$
  M_{\mathrm{red}} := Z/G
$$
is a smooth manifold, and the projection
$$
  \pi:Z\to M_{\mathrm{red}}
$$
is a principal $G$-bundle.

The key question is:

> Can $M_{\mathrm{red}}$ be made into a symplectic manifold such that the inclusion
> $i:Z\hookrightarrow M$ and projection $\pi:Z\to M_{\mathrm{red}}$ are compatible with the symplectic forms?

The answer is yes:

> [!note] Marsden–Weinstein–Meyer Theorem (Regular, free case)
> Let $(M,\omega,G,\mu)$ be a Hamiltonian $G$-space, with $G$ compact.
> Assume that
> - $0\in\mathfrak g^*$ is a regular value of $\mu$, so that $Z:=\mu^{-1}(0)$ is a submanifold of $M$,
> - the $G$-action on $Z$ is free and proper.
> 
> Then:
> 1. The quotient $M_{\mathrm{red}}:=Z/G$ is a smooth manifold.
> 2. There is a **unique** symplectic form $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$ on $M_{\mathrm{red}}$ such that
>    $$i^*\omega=\pi^*\omega_{\mathrm{red}}.$$
> 3. If $\dim M=2n$ and $\dim G=k$, then
>    $$\dim M_{\mathrm{red}}=2n-2k.$$
> 
> The pair $(M_{\mathrm{red}},\omega_{\mathrm{red}})$ is called the **symplectic reduction** or **symplectic quotient** of $(M,\omega)$ by $G$ at level $0$.

The rest of this section is devoted to proving this theorem and understanding its dynamical meaning.

## 6.2 Proof in the regular, free case and reduced dynamics

We work under the hypotheses of the theorem:
- $(M,\omega,G,\mu)$ Hamiltonian,
- $0$ a regular value,
- $G$ acts freely and properly on $Z=\mu^{-1}(0)$.

We break the proof into several geometric lemmas.

### 6.2.1 Geometry of the moment map

Let $p\in M$, and denote by $O_p = G\cdot p$ the $G$-orbit and by $\mathfrak g_p$ the Lie algebra of the stabilizer:
$$\mathfrak{g}_p=\{\xi\in\mathfrak{g}\mid X_\xi(p)=0\}.$$
The tangent space to the orbit is
$$
  T_pO_p = \{ X_\xi(p) \mid \xi\in\mathfrak g\}.
$$

The moment map encodes the orbit directions via $\omega$:

> [!abstract] Proposition 6.2.1 (Kernel and image of $d\mu$)
> For each $p\in M$,
> $$\ker d\mu_p=(T_pO_p)^{\omega_p}$$
> and
> $$\operatorname{im} d\mu_p=\mathfrak g_p^{0}$$
> (the annihilator of $\mathfrak g_p$ in $\mathfrak g^*$).
> 
> In particular, if $0$ is a regular value of $\mu$ and $p\in Z$, then $d\mu_p$ is surjective and
> $$T_pZ=\ker d\mu_p=(T_pO_p)^{\omega_p}.$$

> [!success] Proof  
> Fix $\eta\in\mathfrak g$ and consider the component $\mu^\eta = \langle\mu,\eta\rangle$.  
> By the definition of moment map,
> $$d\mu^\eta=\iota_{X_\eta}\omega.$$
> Thus for $v\in T_pM$,
> $$d\mu_p(v)(\eta)=d\mu^\eta_p(v)=\omega_p(v,X_\eta(p)).$$
> 
> 1. If $v\in \ker d\mu_p$, then $d\mu_p(v)(\eta)=0$ for all $\eta\in\mathfrak g$, hence
>    $$\omega_p(v,X_\eta(p)) = 0 \quad \forall \eta\in\mathfrak g,$$
>    i.e. $v$ is $\omega_p$–orthogonal to $T_pO_p$. So $\ker d\mu_p\subset (T_pO_p)^{\omega_p}$.
> 
> 2. Conversely, if $v\in (T_pO_p)^{\omega_p}$, then $\omega_p(v,X_\eta(p))=0$ for all $\eta$, hence $d\mu_p(v)=0$.  
>    So $(T_pO_p)^{\omega_p}\subset \ker d\mu_p$ and we get equality.
> 
> For the image, note that $d\mu_p$ is the dual map (up to the $\omega$–pairing) of the map
> $$\mathfrak g\to T_pM,\quad \eta\mapsto X_\eta(p),$$
> restricted to $T_pO_p$. The annihilator of $T_pO_p$ consists precisely of those linear functionals on $\mathfrak g$ vanishing on $\mathfrak g_p$. This gives $\operatorname{im}d\mu_p = \mathfrak g_p^{0}$.  
> 
> If $0$ is a regular value and $p\in Z$, $d\mu_p$ is surjective, so $\mathfrak g_p^{0} = \mathfrak g^*$, hence $\mathfrak g_p = 0$, i.e. all stabilizers on $Z$ are discrete. With the freeness assumption, they are trivial.  
> Finally, $T_pZ = \ker d\mu_p$ by the regular value theorem.

As a quick corollary:

> [!abstract] Corollary 6.2.2 (Dimension count)
> If $0$ is a regular value and $G$ acts freely on $Z$, then for each $p\in Z$,
> $$\dim T_pZ = \dim M - \dim\mathfrak g, \qquad \dim T_{[p]}M_{\mathrm{red}} = \dim M - 2\dim\mathfrak g.$$
> In particular, $\dim M_{\mathrm{red}}$ is even.

> [!success] Proof  
> From $T_pZ=\ker d\mu_p$ and surjectivity of $d\mu_p$, we get
> $$\dim T_pZ=\dim M-\dim\mathfrak{g}.$$
> Since $G$ acts freely, $\dim T_pO_p=\dim\mathfrak{g}$, and the orbit directions are exactly the vertical directions of $\pi:Z\to Z/G$. Thus
> $$\dim T_{[p]}M_{\mathrm{red}}=\dim T_p Z-\dim\mathfrak{g}=\dim M-2\dim\mathfrak{g}.$$
> Therefore, $\dim M_{\mathrm{red}}$ is even.

### 6.2.2 Basic property of $\omega$ on the constraint surface

We now analyze the restriction of $\omega$ to the level set $Z$.

Let $i:Z\hookrightarrow M$ be inclusion. Consider the 2–form $i^*\omega$ on $Z$.

> [!abstract] Proposition 6.2.3 (Kernel of the restricted form)
> For each $p\in Z$,
> $$\ker\bigl( (i^*\omega)_p \bigr) = T_pO_p.$$
> In other words, on $Z$ the degenerate directions of $i^*\omega$ are exactly the $G$-orbit directions.

> [!success] Proof  
> Take $v\in T_pZ$. By Proposition 6.2.1,
> $$
>   T_pZ = (T_pO_p)^{\omega_p}.
> $$
> Thus for any $w\in T_pO_p$,
> $$
>   \omega_p(v,w)=0.
> $$
> So $T_pO_p\subset \ker(i^*\omega)_p$.
> 
> Conversely, suppose $v\in T_pZ$ and $\omega_p(v,u)=0$ for all $u\in T_pZ$.  
> We can decompose any vector $u' \in T_pM$ as
> $$
>   u' = u + w, \quad u\in T_pZ,\ w\in T_pO_p,
> $$
> because $T_pZ$ is the $\omega_p$–orthogonal complement of $T_pO_p$ and $\omega_p$ is nondegenerate. Then
> $$
>   \omega_p(v,u') = \omega_p(v,u) + \omega_p(v,w) = 0 + 0 = 0
> $$
> since $v\in T_pZ$ is orthogonal to $T_pO_p$ and we assumed $\omega_p(v,u)=0$ for all $u\in T_pZ$.  
> This forces $v=0$ by nondegeneracy of $\omega_p$ on $T_pM$.
> 
> Thus the only vectors in $T_pZ$ that are $\omega_p$–orthogonal to all of $T_pZ$ are those in $T_pO_p$, and we already know $T_pO_p\subset T_pZ$. Therefore
> $$
>   \ker(i^*\omega)_p = T_pO_p.
> $$

This is the crucial observation: on the constraint surface $Z$, the kernel of $i^*\omega$ is precisely the vertical distribution of the $G$-action.

### 6.2.3 Construction of the reduced symplectic form

We now show that $i^*\omega$ is **basic** with respect to the quotient map $\pi:Z\to M_{\mathrm{red}}$; that is, it is

- $G$-invariant, and  
- horizontal (it vanishes whenever one argument is vertical).

Then it will descend to a unique 2–form $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$ on $M_{\mathrm{red}}$.

> [!abstract] Lemma 6.2.4 (Basicness)
> The 2–form $i^*\omega$ is:
> - $G$-invariant on $Z$;
> - horizontal: for $p\in Z$ and $v\in T_pO_p$,
>   $$(i^*\omega)_p(v,\cdot) = 0.$$
> Hence $i^*\omega$ descends to a unique 2–form $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$ on $M_{\mathrm{red}}$ satisfying $i^*\omega = \pi^*\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$.

> [!success] Proof  
> $G$-invariance of $\omega$ implies $G$-invariance of $i^*\omega$.  
> Horizontality follows from Proposition 6.2.3: the kernel of $(i^*\omega)_p$ is exactly $T_pO_p$.
> 
> Basicness is precisely the condition needed for the existence of a unique form $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$ on $M_{\mathrm{red}}$ such that $\pi^*\omega_{\mathrm{red}} = i^*\omega$.

We still need to check that $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$ is closed and nondegenerate.

> [!abstract] Proposition 6.2.5 (Closedness and nondegeneracy)
> The form $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$ is a symplectic form on $M_{\mathrm{red}}$:
> - $d\omega_{\mathrm{red}} = 0$;
> - for every $[p]\in M_{\mathrm{red}}$, $\omega_{\mathrm{red},[p]}$ is nondegenerate.

> [!success] Proof  
> **Closedness.** Since $d\omega=0$ and $i^*$ and $\pi^*$ commute with $d$,
> $$\pi^*(d\omega_{\mathrm{red}}) = d(\pi^*\omega_{\mathrm{red}}) = d(i^*\omega) = i^*(d\omega) = 0.$$
> Because $\pi^*$ is injective on forms (a basic check using local sections of the principal bundle), we get $d\omega_{\mathrm{red}}=0$.
> 
> **Nondegeneracy.** Let $[p]\in M_{\mathrm{red}}$ and suppose $u\in T_{[p]}M_{\mathrm{red}}$ satisfies
> $$
>   \omega_{\mathrm{red},[p]}(u,\cdot)=0.
> $$
> Let $v\in T_pZ$ be a lift of $u$, so that $d\pi_p(v)=u$. For any $w\in T_pZ$ projecting to some $w'\in T_{[p]}M_{\mathrm{red}}$, we have
> $$ (i^*\omega)_p(v,w) = (\pi^*\omega_{\mathrm{red}})_p(v,w) = \omega_{\mathrm{red},[p]}(d\pi_p(v),d\pi_p(w)) = \omega_{\mathrm{red},[p]}(u,w') = 0.$$
> Thus $v$ is $\omega$–orthogonal to all of $T_pZ$. By Proposition 6.2.3, this implies $v\in T_pO_p$, i.e. $v$ is vertical. But then $u=d\pi_p(v)=0$.  
> Hence the only vector $u$ annihilated by $\omega_{\mathrm{red},[p]}$ is the zero vector, so $\omega_{\mathrm{red},[p]}$ is nondegenerate.

Combining these results we obtain the Marsden–Weinstein–Meyer theorem in the regular, free case.

### 6.2.4 Reduced Hamiltonian dynamics

We now explain how a $G$-invariant Hamiltonian system on $(M,\omega)$ reduces to a Hamiltonian system on $(M_{\mathrm{red}},\omega_{\mathrm{red}})$.

Let $H\in C^\infty(M)$ be a Hamiltonian such that
$$
  H(g\cdot p) = H(p)\quad\forall g\in G,\,p\in M
$$
(i.e. $H$ is $G$-invariant), with Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ defined by
$$
  \iota_{X_H}\omega = dH.
$$

We want:

1. $X_H$ to be tangent to the level set $Z=\mu^{-1}(0)$;
2. The flow of $X_H$ to commute with the $G$-action;
3. A Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{red}}$ on $M_{\mathrm{red}}$ whose flow corresponds to the projected dynamics.

> [!abstract] Proposition 6.2.6 (Tangency to the constraint surface)
> If $H$ is $G$-invariant, then $X_H$ is tangent to each level set of the moment map.
> In particular, $X_H$ preserves $Z=\mu^{-1}(0)$.

> [!success] Proof  
> Fix $\xi\in\mathfrak g$ and consider the component $\mu^\xi = \langle\mu,\xi\rangle$.  
> Because $H$ is $G$-invariant,
> $$0 = \mathcal L_{X_\xi}H = \{H,\mu^\xi\} = -\{\mu^\xi,H\}.$$
> Using the identification of Hamiltonian vector fields with Poisson brackets,
> $$\{\mu^\xi,H\} = d\mu^\xi(X_H).$$
> Hence $d\mu^\xi(X_H)=0$ for all $\xi$, so $d\mu(X_H)=0$, i.e. $X_H$ is everywhere tangent to the level sets of $\mu$.  
> Therefore $X_H$ preserves $Z=\mu^{-1}(0)$.

Now define the reduced Hamiltonian:

> [!info] Reduced Hamiltonian
> On $M_{\mathrm{red}}$, define $H_{\mathrm{red}}\in C^\infty(M_{\mathrm{red}})$ by
> $$H_{\mathrm{red}}([p]) := H(p),\quad p\in Z.$$
> This is well-defined because $H$ is $G$-invariant.

We then have:

> [!note] Theorem 6.2.7 (Reduced dynamics)
> Let $(M,\omega,G,\mu)$ satisfy the Marsden–Weinstein hypotheses, and let $H$ be a $G$-invariant Hamiltonian.
> Then:
> 1. The vector field $X_H$ is tangent to $Z$ and $G$-equivariant.
> 2. There exists a unique vector field $X_{H_{\mathrm{red}}}$ on $(M_{\mathrm{red}},\omega_{\mathrm{red}})$ such that
>    $$d\pi\circ X_H|_Z = X_{H_{\mathrm{red}}}\circ \pi.$$
> 3. The field $X_{H_{\mathrm{red}}}$ is the Hamiltonian vector field of $H_{\mathrm{red}}$ with respect to $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$:
>    $$\iota_{X_{H_{\mathrm{red}}}}\omega_{\mathrm{red}} = dH_{\mathrm{red}}.$$

> [!success] Proof (sketch)  
> (1) We already saw tangency in Proposition 6.2.6; $G$-equivariance of $X_H$ follows from $G$-invariance of $\omega$ and $H$.
> 
> (2) Since $X_H$ is tangent to $Z$ and $G$-equivariant, it descends to a vector field on the quotient. This defines $X_{H_{\mathrm{red}}}$.
> 
> (3) For $[p]\in M_{\mathrm{red}}$ and $u'\in T_{[p]}M_{\mathrm{red}}$, choose $v\in T_pZ$ and $w\in T_pZ$ with $d\pi_p(v)=X_{H_{\mathrm{red}}}([p])$ and $d\pi_p(w)=u'$. Then
> $$\omega_{\mathrm{red},[p]}(X_{H_{\mathrm{red}}}([p]),u') = (i^*\omega)_p(v,w) = \omega_p(X_H(p),w) = dH_p(w).$$
> But $H_{\mathrm{red}}\circ\pi = H|_Z$, so
> $$dH_{\mathrm{red},[p]}(u')=dH_p(w).$$
> Thus $\iota_{X_{H_{\mathrm{red}}}}\omega_{\mathrm{red}} = dH_{\mathrm{red}}$.

So $G$-invariant Hamiltonian dynamics on $M$ descend canonically to Hamiltonian dynamics on the reduced symplectic manifold $M_{\mathrm{red}}$.

## 6.3 Examples of symplectic reduction

We now work through several important examples where one can compute the reduced space and symplectic form explicitly.

### 6.3.1 $S^1$ on $\mathbb C^{n+1}$: reduction to $(\mathbb CP^n,\omega_{\mathrm{FS}})$

Let $M = \mathbb C^{n+1}$ with coordinates $z=(z_0,\dots,z_n)$ and the standard symplectic form
$$\omega_0=\sum_{j=0}^n dx_j\wedge dy_j$$
where $z_j=x_j+i y_j$.

Let $S^1$ act by scalar multiplication:
$$e^{i\theta}\cdot z = (e^{i\theta} z_0,\dots,e^{i\theta}z_n).$$

This action is linear, preserves $\omega_0$ and is Hamiltonian.

> [!abstract] Proposition 6.3.1 (Moment map for scalar $S^1$–action)
> The $S^1$–action on $(\mathbb C^{n+1},\omega_0)$ is Hamiltonian with moment map
> $$\mu(z) = \frac{1}{2}\bigl( \lVert z\rVert^2 - 1\bigr) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{j=0}^n |z_j|^2 - 1\right).$$

> [!success] Proof  
> The generating vector field of the action is
> $$X(z) = \left.\frac{d}{d\theta}\right|_{\theta=0} e^{i\theta}\cdot z = i z,$$
> i.e. in real coordinates
> $$
>   X = \sum_{j=0}^n (-y_j \partial_{x_j} + x_j \partial_{y_j}).
> $$
> We compute
> $$
>   \iota_X\omega_0
>   = \sum_{j=0}^n \bigl( dx_j(X) \, dy_j - dy_j(X)\, dx_j\bigr)
>   = \sum_{j=0}^n (-y_j dy_j - x_j dx_j)
>   = -\frac12 d\sum_{j=0}^n (x_j^2 + y_j^2).
> $$
> So if we set
> $$\mu(z) := \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{j=0}^n (x_j^2+y_j^2) - 1\right) = \frac12\left(\sum_{j=0}^n |z_j|^2 - 1\right),$$
> then
> $$d\mu = \frac12 d\sum_{j=0}^n (x_j^2+y_j^2) = -\iota_X\omega_0.$$
> Up to the sign convention for the moment map, this is a valid moment map; the constant $-1/2$ is chosen so that $\mu^{-1}(0)$ is the unit sphere.

The zero level set is
$$Z=\mu^{-1}(0)=\{z\in \mathbb{C}^{n+1}\mid \|z\|^2=1\}=S^{2n+1}.$$

The $S^1$–action is free on $Z$ (no fixed points on the unit sphere), and the quotient is the projective space:
$$
  Z/S^1 \cong \mathbb CP^n.
$$

> [!info] Hopf fibration and reduction
> The projection
> $$
>   \pi:S^{2n+1}\to \mathbb CP^n,\quad
>   \pi(z_0,\dots,z_n) = [z_0:\dots:z_n]
> $$
> is the **Hopf fibration**. As a smooth map its fibres are $S^1$–orbits, so
> $$
>   S^{2n+1}/S^1 \cong \mathbb CP^n
> $$
> as smooth manifolds.
> The Marsden–Weinstein construction endows this quotient with a unique symplectic form $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$ such that
> $$i^*\omega_0 = \pi^*\omega_{\mathrm{red}}.$$

One can check that $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$ is precisely (a normalization of) the **Fubini–Study form** $\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}$ on $\mathbb CP^n$:

> [!abstract] Proposition 6.3.2 (Fubini–Study form via reduction)
> Under the identification $M_{\mathrm{red}}\cong\mathbb CP^n$,
> the reduced symplectic form $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}$ coincides with the standard Fubini–Study form $\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}$.

> [!success] Proof (sketch)  
> In homogeneous coordinates, one can show that for the standard projection
> $$\mathrm{pr}:\mathbb C^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}\to \mathbb CP^n,$$
> the pullback of $\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}$ is given by
> $$\mathrm{pr}^*\omega_{\mathrm{FS}} = i\partial\bar\partial \log\lVert z\rVert^2.$$
> Restricting to $S^{2n+1}$, where $\lVert z\rVert^2=1$, and comparing with $\omega_0$ shows that
> $$i^*\omega_0 = \pi^*\omega_{\mathrm{FS}},$$
> so $\omega_{\mathrm{red}}=\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}$.

So we have the canonical identification
$$
  \bigl(\mathbb CP^n,\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}\bigr)
  \cong S^{2n+1}//S^1
  := (\mu^{-1}(0)/S^1,\omega_{\mathrm{red}}).
$$

---

### 6.3.2 The case $n=1$: $S^3//S^1\cong (S^2,\text{area form})$

For $n=1$ we get $M=\mathbb C^2$, $Z=S^3$, and $M_{\mathrm{red}}\cong\mathbb CP^1\cong S^2$.

> [!example] Example 6.3.3 (Reduction and the 2–sphere)
> - Start with $(\mathbb C^2,\omega_0)$ and the scalar $S^1$–action with moment map
>   $$\mu(z_0,z_1) = \frac12(|z_0|^2+|z_1|^2 - 1).$$
> - Then $Z=\mu^{-1}(0)$ is $S^3$ of radius $1$.
> - The quotient $Z/S^1$ is $\mathbb CP^1\cong S^2$.
> - The reduced symplectic form is the standard area form on $S^2$ of total area $2\pi$ (depending on normalization).

Geometrically: the Hopf fibration $S^3\to S^2$ is a principal $S^1$–bundle, and the standard area form on $S^2$ is chosen so that its pullback is the restriction of the ambient $\omega_0$.

This example can be interpreted as the reduced phase space of a particle moving on $S^3$ with symmetry given by phase rotations.

---

### 6.3.3 Reduction of cotangent bundles

Let $Q$ be a smooth manifold with a free and proper action of a compact Lie group $G$.  

We consider the Hamiltonian $G$-space $(T^* Q,\omega_{\mathrm{can}})$, where
$$
  \omega_{\mathrm{can}} = d\lambda_{\mathrm{can}}
$$
is the canonical symplectic form, and $G$ acts by lifting the action on $Q$.

Recall from the previous chapter that this lifted action is Hamiltonian with moment map
$$
  \mu:T^* Q\to\mathfrak g^*,\qquad
  \langle\mu(q,\alpha_q),\xi\rangle = \alpha_q(\xi_Q(q)),
$$
where $\xi_Q$ is the fundamental vector field on $Q$ generated by $\xi\in\mathfrak g$.

The zero level set of $\mu$ consists of those covectors annihilating the vertical directions:

$$
  \mu(q,\alpha_q)=0 \iff
  \alpha_q\bigl(\xi_Q(q)\bigr) = 0\quad\forall \xi\in\mathfrak g.
$$

Thus
$$
  Z := \mu^{-1}(0) = \{ (q,\alpha_q)\in T^* Q \mid \alpha_q|_{T_q(G\cdot q)} = 0\}.
$$

> [!abstract] Theorem 6.3.4 (Cotangent bundle reduction)
> Let $Q$ be a smooth manifold with a free and proper $G$-action, and consider the Hamiltonian $G$-space $(T^* Q,\omega_{\mathrm{can}},\mu)$ as above.
> Then:
> 1. The quotient $T^* Q//G := \mu^{-1}(0)/G$ is canonically symplectomorphic to $(T^*(Q/G),\omega_{\mathrm{can}})$.
> 2. Under this identification, the reduced symplectic form coincides with the canonical symplectic form on $T^*(Q/G)$.

> [!success] Proof (outline)  
> 1. Because $G$ acts freely and properly on $Q$, the quotient $Q/G$ is a smooth manifold and the projection
>    $$
>      \pi_Q:Q\to Q/G
>    $$
>    is a principal $G$-bundle. Its vertical space at $q$ is $V_q = T_q(G\cdot q)$.
> 
> 2. Define the annihilator subbundle
>    $$
>      V^\circ := \{(q,\alpha_q)\in T^* Q \mid \alpha_q|_{V_q}=0\}\subset T^* Q.
>    $$
>    By definition, $V^\circ = \mu^{-1}(0)$.
> 
> 3. For each $q\in Q$ and $\beta_{[q]}\in T^*_{[q]}(Q/G)$, define
>    $$
>      \tilde\beta_q:T_qQ\to\mathbb R,\quad
>      \tilde\beta_q(u) := \beta_{[q]}(d\pi_Q(u)).
>    $$
>    Then $\tilde\beta_q$ vanishes on $V_q$, so $(q,\tilde\beta_q)\in V^\circ$.
>    This gives a map
>    $$
>      \Phi:T^*(Q/G)\to V^\circ/G,\quad
>      \Phi([q],\beta_{[q]}) = [q,\tilde\beta_q].
>    $$
> 
> 4. One checks that $\Phi$ is well-defined and is a diffeomorphism.  
>    Intuitively: $V^\circ$ is the “horizontal cotangent bundle” and quotienting by $G$ identifies each orbit of such covectors with a unique covector on $Q/G$.
> 
> 5. Finally, one shows that $\Phi$ is a symplectomorphism: the canonical 1–form $\lambda_{\mathrm{can}}$ on $T^* Q$ restricts to a $G$-basic 1–form on $V^\circ$, which descends to the canonical 1–form on $T^*(Q/G)$. Taking $d$ shows that the reduced 2–form matches $\omega_{\mathrm{can}}$.
> 
> Therefore $T^* Q//G$ is naturally identified with $T^*(Q/G)$ as symplectic manifolds.

> [!example] Example 6.3.5 (A simple mechanical example)
> Let $Q=\mathbb R^2\setminus\{0\}$ and let $G=S^1$ act by rotations. Then $Q/G\cong (0,\infty)$ parametrized by the radius $r$.

## 6.4 Singular and orbifold reduction

So far we have assumed that:

- the level $0$ is regular, and  
- the $G$-action is free on $\mu^{-1}(0)$.

In practice, one frequently encounters situations where these hypotheses fail:

- **Non-free action** at a regular value: quotient is an **orbifold**;
- **Singular value** of the moment map: quotient is a **stratified symplectic space**.

We briefly describe both phenomena and give explicit examples.

### 6.4.1 Orbifold reduction

Suppose that $(M,\omega,G,\mu)$ is a Hamiltonian $G$-space, and let $\xi\in\mathfrak g^*$ be a regular value of $\mu$.  
Assume that the $G$-action on $Z_\xi := \mu^{-1}(\xi)$ is **locally free**: stabilizers are finite but not necessarily trivial.

Then $Z_\xi/G$ is no longer a manifold, but it has a canonical orbifold structure, and the reduced 2–form descends to a symplectic form on this orbifold.

> A **symplectic orbifold** of dimension $2n$ is a Hausdorff topological space $X$ covered by charts of the form

> - its pullback to each $\tilde U$ is a $\Gamma$–invariant symplectic form;
> - on overlaps the forms are compatible in the usual sense.

In the reduction context, one has:

> [!note] Theorem 6.4.1 (Orbifold Marsden–Weinstein reduction, torus case)
> Let $G=T^k$ be a torus acting Hamiltonianly on $(M,\omega)$ with moment map $\mu:M\to\mathfrak t^*$.

> [!success] Proof (idea)  
> Regularity of $\xi$ implies that $\mu^{-1}(\xi)$ is a submanifold of codimension $k$. Local freeness means the stabilizers are finite, so the quotient inherits an orbifold structure from the slice theorem and local linearization of the $T^k$–action.
> The same argument as in the free case shows that $i^*\omega$ is basic and descends to a nondegenerate closed 2–form on the orbifold charts, compatible on overlaps.

A basic family of examples arises from $S^1$–actions on $\mathbb C^n$ with different weights.

> [!example] Example 6.4.2 (Weighted projective spaces and teardrop orbifold)
> Consider the $S^1$–action on $\mathbb C^2$ given by
> $$e^{i\theta}\cdot (z_1,z_2) = (e^{ik\theta}z_1, e^{i\theta}z_2),\quad k\ge 2.$$

>    for a suitable constant $c$.
> 
> 2. For any regular value $\xi<0$, the level set $\mu^{-1}(\xi)$ is a 3–dimensional ellipsoid.
> 
> 3. The stabilizer of a point $(z_1,z_2)\in\mu^{-1}(\xi)$ is
>    - trivial if $z_2\neq 0$,
>    - the finite group $\mathbb Z_k$ if $z_2=0$.
> 
> 4. The quotient
>    $$\mu^{-1}(\xi)/S^1$$
>    is a 2–dimensional orbifold with one singular point of cone angle $2\pi/k$.
>    It is often called the **teardrop orbifold** or **conehead**.
> 
> More generally, the reduction of $\mathbb C^n$ by an $S^1$–action with weights $(k_1,\dots,k_n)$ produces the **weighted projective space** $\mathbb CP^{n-1}_{(k_1,\dots,k_n)}$, again a symplectic orbifold.

In all these cases, the symplectic form produced by reduction is well-defined in the orbifold sense and gives a rich source of examples in 2 and 4 real dimensions.

### 6.4.2 Singular values and stratified symplectic spaces

When $\xi$ is not a regular value, the level set $\mu^{-1}(\xi)$ need not be a manifold, and even if it is, the $G$-action may fail to be locally free in a highly nontrivial way.  

The quotient $\mu^{-1}(\xi)/G$ is then genuinely singular, but it still carries a remnant of symplectic geometry.

> [!info] Stratified symplectic space (very informal)
> A **stratified symplectic space** is a topological space $X$ together with:
> - a decomposition
>   $$
>     X = \bigsqcup_{\alpha} X_\alpha
>   $$
>   into locally closed smooth manifolds $X_\alpha$ (the **strata**), ordered by inclusion of closures;
> - a symplectic form $\omega_\alpha$ on each stratum $X_\alpha$;
> - a notion of smooth function $C^\infty(X)$ whose restriction to each $X_\alpha$ is smooth and such that the corresponding Poisson brackets restrict to the usual ones on each stratum.
> 
> The strata fit together in a way compatible with the Poisson structure.

A deep theorem (Lerman–Sjamaar) states that symplectic reduction always produces objects of this type.

> [!note] Theorem 6.4.3 (Lerman–Sjamaar, very special case)
> Let $(M,\omega,G,\mu)$ be a Hamiltonian $G$-space with $G$ compact.  
> Fix $\xi\in\mathfrak g^*$ and consider the quotient
> $$
>   M_\xi := \mu^{-1}(\xi)/G.
> $$
> Then:
> - $M_\xi$ admits a canonical decomposition into **orbit type strata**,
>   each of which is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form induced from $\omega$;
> - this decomposition turns $M_\xi$ into a stratified symplectic space.
> 
> On the open dense stratum (corresponding to minimal stabilizer type) the reduction coincides with ordinary Marsden–Weinstein reduction.

> [!success] Proof (idea)  
> The proof uses the slice theorem and a local normal form for Hamiltonian actions. Locally near a point with stabilizer $H$, the action looks like a product of a coadjoint orbit and a linear symplectic $H$–representation, and the moment map takes a normal form.  
> Analyzing the orbit types of stabilizers and their images under $\mu$ yields a stratification of $\mu^{-1}(\xi)$ by smooth manifolds on which standard reduction applies. Passing to the quotient produces a stratification of $M_\xi$ by symplectic manifolds glued along lower–dimensional pieces.

Instead of a full proof, we illustrate what can go wrong with a simple example.

> [!example] Example 6.4.4 (A first singular reduction)
> Let $S^1$ act on $(\mathbb C^2,\omega_0)$ by
> $$e^{i\theta}\cdot (z_1,z_2) = (e^{i\theta} z_1, e^{-i\theta} z_2).$$
> A moment map is
> $$\mu(z_1,z_2) = \frac12\bigl(|z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2\bigr).$$
> Consider the zero level:
> $$\mu^{-1}(0) = \{(z_1,z_2)\mid |z_1|^2 = |z_2|^2\}.$$
> This set is a cone over the 3–sphere $\{(z_1,z_2)\mid |z_1|=|z_2|=1\}$, with the cone point at $(0,0)$.
> 
> - Away from $(0,0)$, $\mu^{-1}(0)$ is a smooth 3–manifold, and the $S^1$–action has finite stabilizers.
> - At $(0,0)$, the level set is singular: no neighborhood of $(0,0)$ is diffeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb R^3$.
> 
> The quotient $\mu^{-1}(0)/S^1$ therefore has:

> - lower–dimensional strata corresponding to points with larger stabilizers,

> Each stratum is symplectic, but the ambient space is not a manifold.

This is the typical picture in many interesting problems: reduction produces a space that is symplectic on large open pieces but has singularities where stabilizers jump or the moment map is singular.

In the next chapters we will see how symplectic reduction interacts with more structured settings (toric manifolds, integrable systems) and how the topology of the reduced spaces encodes global information about the original Hamiltonian system.
